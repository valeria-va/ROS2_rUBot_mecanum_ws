SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) navigation aims to simultaneously map an unknown environment and localize the robot within it. It generates an optimal trajectory to a specified target point and navigates along this path, continuously updating the map and avoiding obstacles to ensure efficient and autonomous movement.

There are different methods:
- SLAM gmapping: to create 2D occupancy maps from laser and position data. Ideal for small indoor environments with low scan frequency.
- Cartographer: Provides real-time SLAM in 2D and 3D, compatible with multiple platforms and sensor configurations. Known for its accuracy and ability to work with multi-sensor data.
- RTAB-MAP: A library and standalone application for visual and lidar SLAM. Supports various platforms and sensors.

## **4.1. SLAM-Navigation install**

You need first to install the needed packages (already installed in TheConstruct environment):
```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-navigation2 ros-humble-nav2-bringup
sudo apt install ros-humble-nav2-simple-commander
sudo apt install ros-humble-tf-transformations
```
We will start to use Turtlebot3 waffle model but later we will adapt our custom robot model

From Turtlebot3 project we have taken the "turtlebot3_cartographer" and "turtlebot3_navigation2" packages and copy to src folder with the structure:
- Navigation_Projects
    - my_robot_cartographer
    - my_robotnavigation2
    - my_robot_nav_control
- This new "my_robot_nav_control" package is created for new navigation control projects using Simple Commander API. This package is created with:
````shell
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python my_robot_nav_control --dependencies rclpy std_msgs sensor_msgs geometry_msgs nav_msgs nav2_simple_commander tf_transformations
cd ..
colcon build
````

- Open .bashrc and verify if there are these lines:
````shell
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=/home/user/ROS2_rUBot_mecanum_ws/src/my_robot_bringup/models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash
source /home/user/ROS2_rUBot_tutorial_ws/install/setup.bash
source /home/user/ROS2_rUBot_mecanum_ws/install/setup.bash
#cd /home/user/ROS2_rUBot_tutorial_ws
cd /home/user/ROS2_rUBot_mecanum_ws
````

## **4.2. Generate a Map with SLAM**

- Fist of all you have to bringup the robot in the desired environment:
    - In the case of Virtual environment:
        ````shell
        ros2 launch my_robot_bringup my_robot_bringup_sw.launch.xml use_sim_time:=True x0:=0.5 y0:=-1.5 yaw0:=1.57 robot:=rubot/rubot_mecanum.urdf custom_world:=square4m_sign.world
        ````
        >Change the custom_world with the world name you have created
    - In the case of a real robot:
        ````shell
        ros2 launch my_robot_bringup my_robot_nano_bringup_hw.launch.py
        ````    
- to generate the map:
    - In the case of Virtual environment:
    ````shell
    ros2 launch my_robot_cartographer cartographer.launch.py use_sim_time:=True
    ````
    >use_sim_time have to be True when using Gazebo for Virtual simulation
    - In the case of real robot:
    ````shell
    ros2 topic pub --once /reset_odom std_msgs/msg/Bool "{data: true}"
    ros2 launch my_robot_cartographer cartographer.launch.py use_sim_time:=False
    ````
- Navigate on the world to store the map
    ````shell
    ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
    ````
- Save the map in my_robot_navigation2/map folder with:
    ````shell
    cd src/Navigation_Projects/my_robot_navigation2/map/
    ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f my_map
    ````

## **4.3. Navigate inside Map**

- Fist of all we have to make a correction because sometimes the Map is not read correctly or ontime (this is already installed in our Dockerfile.robot):
    - Install ros-humble-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp
    ````shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ros-humble-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp
    ````
    - Add the environment variable in .bashrc
    ````shell
    export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
    ````
- Let`s now make the robot navigate using the Map:
    - In the case of Virtual environment:
        ````shell
        ros2 launch my_robot_bringup my_robot_bringup_sw.launch.xml use_sim_time:=True x0:=0.5 y0:=-1.5 yaw0:=1.57 robot:=robot_arm/my_simple_robot.urdf custom_world:=square4m_sign.world
        ````
        >Change the URDF file for each robot
        - Launch Navigation node: python launcher is more powerfull than previous xml format
        ````bash
        ros2 launch my_robot_navigation2 navigation2_robot.launch.py use_sim_time:=True robot:=robot_arm/my_simple_robot.urdf map_file:=map_square4m_sign.yaml params_file:=rubot_sw.yaml 
        ````
        >For LIMO: We use "limo_sw.yaml" file. In case we want to priorize the lidar data from odometry data we will use Limo_sw_lidar.yaml
    - In the case of real robot:
        ````shell
        ros2 launch my_robot_navigation2 navigation2_robot.launch.py use_sim_time:=False robot:=robot_arm/my_simple_robot.urdf map_file:=my_map.yaml params_file:=rubot_real.yaml
        ````
        > If you do not see the MAP in rviz2, close the terminal execution (crtl+C) and start again until you see the Map.

        > An error appears in "Global status" due to the unlocalization of your robot in the map. When you localize your robot in the map this error desappears.
- Localize the robot on the map using "2D-Pose estimate". The "Global Planner" and "Controller" will be updated and NO errors will appear
- Navigate on the MAP with Nav2
    - Selecty 1 target point
    - Select multiple waypoints with "Waypoint/Nav through Poses Mode" option
    - Select a unique trajectory following the different Waypoints with the "Start Nav Through Poses" option

## **4.4. Interact Programmatically with Nav2**

You will use Simple Commander API to interact with Topics subscribers, Service clients and Action clients.

The interesting topics used:
- /initialpose (geometry_msgs)

The interesting actions used:
- /navigate_to_pose
- /follow_waypoints

we need to install (already installed in our Dockerfile.robot):
````shell
sudo apt install ros-humble-nav2-simple-commander
sudo apt install ros-humble-tf-transformations
````
We can create a python file to interact with topics and actions.

To navigate programmatically using Simple Commander API, you have to proceed with:
- Bringup the robot in the desired environment:
    - In the case of Virtual environment:
        ````shell
        ros2 launch my_robot_bringup my_robot_bringup_sw.launch.xml use_sim_time:=True x0:=0.5 y0:=-1.5 yaw0:=1.57 robot:=robot_arm/my_simple_robot.urdf  custom_world:=square4m_sign.world
        ````
    - In the case of a real robot, the bringup is already made when turned on
- Start the navigation2.launch.py with rviz to see the evolution of robot navigation
    - In the case of Virtual environment:
        ````shell
        ros2 launch my_robot_navigation2 navigation2_robot.launch.py use_sim_time:=True robot:=robot_arm/my_simple_robot.urdf map_file:=map_square4m_sign.yaml params_file:=rubot_sw.yaml
        ````
        - In the case of real robot:
        ````shell
        ros2 launch my_robot_navigation2 navigation2_robot.launch.py use_sim_time:=False robot:=robot_arm/my_simple_robot.urdf map_file:=map_square4m_sign.yaml params_file:=rubot_real.yaml
        ````
- Launch the created python file to define the Initial point and one target point:the targets waypoints
    ````shell
    ros2 launch my_robot_nav_control nav_target.launch.py
    ````
- Launch the created python file to define the Initial point and some targets waypoints defined in config folder:
    ````
    ros2 launch my_robot_nav_control nav_waypoints.launch.py
    ````
    >First time we pass the 2D-Pose-Estimate but not the successive times
