# TP-Link AC600 (RTL8811AU/RTL8821CU) Driver Installation on Ubuntu 22.04

This guide explains how to install the **TP-Link Archer T2U Nano AC600** Wi-Fi adapter driver on Ubuntu 22.04.  
The chipset is **Realtek RTL8811AU / RTL8821CU**, which is not supported by default.

---

## 1. Prepare the system

Make sure you have the required tools to compile DKMS drivers:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms git linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

---

## 2. Clone the correct repository

The following repository supports **RTL8811AU/RTL8821CU** chipsets:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/morrownr/8821cu-20210916.git
cd 8821cu-20210916
```

---

## 3. Install the driver

Run the installation script:

```bash
sudo ./install-driver.sh
```

- If asked about editing driver options → answer **`N` (No)**.  
- Options can be edited later manually if needed.

---

## 4. Configure driver options (recommended)

To disable USB power saving and avoid disconnections, add:

```bash
echo "options 8821cu rtw_power_mgnt=0 rtw_enusbss=0 rtw_ips_mode=0" | \
  sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/8821cu.conf
```

---

## 5. Load the module and restart services

```bash
sudo modprobe -r 8821cu || true
sudo modprobe 8821cu
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

If the interface does not appear, unplug and replug the Wi-Fi dongle.

---

## 6. Verify the interface

```bash
ip link             # should show 'wlan0' or 'wlx...' interface
nmcli dev status    # should show 'wifi' as available
nmcli dev wifi list # should list available Wi-Fi networks
```

---

## 7. Connect to a Wi-Fi network

You can connect via Network Manager GUI (top-right menu)  
or via terminal:

```bash
nmcli dev wifi connect "SSID_NAME" password "SSID_PASSWORD"
```

---

## 8. Check your IP address

```bash
hostname -I
ip a
```

Your Wi-Fi interface should have an IP like `192.168.1.xxx`.

---

## 9. Uninstall the driver (if needed)

If you want to remove the driver:

```bash
cd ~/8821cu-20210916
sudo ./remove-driver.sh
```

---

✅ With this, the TP-Link AC600 dongle should work correctly on Ubuntu 22.04 with full Wi-Fi connectivity.
